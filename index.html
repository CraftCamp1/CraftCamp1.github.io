                <li>There are over a thousand types of bananas, but most of us only ever meet one. Feels a bit unfair.</li>

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>In the late 1800s, a penniless teenager named Sam saw ripe bananas as trash. He bought them cheap, raced across states in a boxcar, and sold them for a profit. His first win set the stage for today’s global banana trade.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- first banana -->
                <div class="story-section" id="story-first-banana">
                    <img src="images/slideimg2.png" alt="Vintage market stall with bananas">
                    <h3>The First Banana</h3>
                    <p>Few Americans had tasted a banana back then. Sam learned every job in his uncle’s store so he knew what customers wanted. When he spotted that yellow fruit, he bet his savings on selling riped fruit fast. That moment created a new
                        demand for bananas in supermarkets everywhere.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- race against time -->
                <div class="story-section" id="story-race">
                    <img src="images/slideimg3.png" alt="Old railway boxcar loaded with produce">
                    <h3>A Race Against Time</h3>
                    <p>Without refrigeration, up to 15% of bananas spoiled at sea. Sam bought a train car, wired telegraphs to alert towns, and sold every banana before it turned black. Today’s cold chains and fast logistics still borrow from his fast-sell
                        playbook.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Building an Empire</h3>
                    <p>By 1903 Sam signed a deal with United Fruit to buy every ripe batch. He then bought ships, built plantations in Honduras and bribed officials to cut costs. That model of vertical control still echoes in modern agro-business, for better
                        and worse.</p>

                    <h3>Today’s Impact</h3>
                    <p>Bananas remain one of the world’s top crops. Supply chains, fair-trade labels and disease-resistant varieties all trace back to Sam’s strategies. Next time you peel one for breakfast, you’re tasting a century of logistics, science
                        and social change.</p>
