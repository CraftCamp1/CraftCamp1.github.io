            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul class="fact-list">
                <li>Bananas are technically berries. Weirdly, strawberries aren't. Biology is just making stuff up now.</li>
                <li>If you throw a banana into water, it floats. Turns out, bananas don’t like to sink.</li>
                <li>There are over a thousand types of bananas, but most of us only ever meet one. Feels a bit unfair.</li>
                <li>The kind you see in stores is called Cavendish. Sounds like it should come with a butler.</li>
                <li>Bananas grow on what looks like a tree, but surprise — it’s actually a giant herb. Nature’s prank.</li>
                <li>A banana plant can grow taller than your living room ceiling. It’s not messing around.</li>
                <li>If a mosquito bites you, rub a banana peel on it. It actually helps. No one knows why.</li>

                <li>Banana plants grow little side shoots called suckers. They’re basically banana backups.</li>

                <li>Banana peels can help with acne. Who needs skincare when you’ve got fruit?</li>
                <li>Run out of eggs? Mashed bananas can step in for baking. They’re team players like that.</li>
                <li>Banana plants grow, fruit, die, and repeat. It’s dramatic, but they get the job done.</li>
                <li>A bunch of bananas is called a “hand” and each banana is a “finger.” Makes it weirdly personal.</li>

                        <img src="images/railroad_debt.jpg" alt="Vintage map of Honduran railroad lines with British bank logos">
                        <h3>Railroad Debt & Political Leverage</h3>
                        <p>By 1900, Honduras owed some $100 million to British banks for a half‑built national railroad—and faced potential British naval action if it defaulted.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. tapped J.P. Morgan to refinance the debt in exchange for control of rail lines and import taxes—blindsiding smaller exporters.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Slide 1 -->
                    <div class="slide" data-index="1">
                        <img src="images/sam_coup.jpg" alt="Archival photo of Sam Zemurray or stylized coup poster">
                        <h3>Sam’s Secret Coup Plan</h3>
                        <p>When Honduran leaders balked on his tax‑breaks, Sam Zemurray quietly funded a rebellion to overthrow them and install a friendlier president—defying J.P. Morgan and the U.S. State Dept.</p>
                        <p>This set the template for “banana republic” politics, where fruit companies pulled presidential strings.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Slide 2 -->
                    <div class="slide" data-index="2">
                        <img src="images/banana_wars.jpg" alt="Newspaper montage about Sherman Antitrust vs United Fruit">
                        <h3>Antitrust & the Banana “Wars”</h3>
                        <p>Responding to a U.S. Justice Dept. antitrust probe, United Fruit sold its 10 % stake in Zemurray’s Kiamal Fruit—creating a faux competitor to dodge monopoly charges.</p>
                        <p>It sparked a full‑blown “banana war,” with UF and Kiamal jockeying for control of plantations, waterways and markets.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Slide 3 -->
                    <div class="slide" data-index="3">
                        <img src="images/banana_massacre.jpg" alt="Black-and-white photo of massacre aftermath">
                        <h3>The Banana Massacre (1928)</h3>
                        <p>When Colombian workers struck for better pay, UF‑backed troops slaughtered unarmed men, women and children—justifying it as anti‑communist action.</p>
                        <p>This cemented UF’s image as a corporate state, capable of ordering mass murder to protect profits.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Slide 4 -->
                    <div class="slide" data-index="4">
                        <img src="images/cia_guatemala.jpg" alt="Declassified CIA map of Guatemala">
                        <h3>CIA & the 1954 Guatemala Coup</h3>
                        <p>UF financed PR campaigns labeling President Árbenz a Communist threat. The CIA trained rebels, bombarded the country, and forced Árbenz’s resignation.</p>
                        <p>This was one of the CIA’s first overt regime‑change ops, executed on UF ships and with its money.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Slide 5 -->
                    <div class="slide" data-index="5">
                        <img src="images/gros_michel_vs_cavendish.jpg" alt="Side‑by‑side of Gros Michel vs Cavendish bananas">
                        <h3>Gros Michel vs. Cavendish</h3>
                        <p>Until the 1950s, “Big Mike” (Gros Michel) ruled—but its genetic uniformity meant Panama disease could wipe entire plantations.</p>
                        <p>UF sprayed poisonous fungicide en masse—poisoning workers—before switching to Cavendish, which was briefly disease‑resistant.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Slide 6 -->
                    <div class="slide" data-index="6">
                        <img src="images/ww2_bananas.jpg" alt="UF banana ship repurposed as troop transport">
                        <h3>World War II Disruption & Diversification</h3>
                        <p>Britain and the U.S. banned banana imports as a “luxury,” seizing UF’s “Great White Fleet” for wartime use—leaving fields to rot.</p>
                        <p>Zemurray pivoted UF into sugarcane, hemp and palm oil—military‑essential crops—to keep the business afloat.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Slide 7 -->
                    <div class="slide" data-index="7">
                        <img src="images/postwar_antitrust.jpg" alt="Courtroom sketch of antitrust case">
                        <h3>Post‑War Antitrust & Decline</h3>
                        <p>In 1958 UF settled another antitrust suit by selling off 33 fields to a rival—marking the beginning of the end of its foreign empire.</p>
                        <p>Legal blows and emerging TR4 strains forced UF into perpetual decline.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Slide 8 -->
                    <div class="slide" data-index="8">

                        <h3>Legacy & Rebranding</h3>
                        <p>In the 1970s UF rebranded as Chiquita to shake its dark reputation—even so, it faced a $25 million DOJ fine in 2007 for terror‑group payments in Colombia.</p>
                        <p>Today’s banana business still wrestles with labor rights, disease and political meddling—a legacy born in the “Banana Wars.”</p>
